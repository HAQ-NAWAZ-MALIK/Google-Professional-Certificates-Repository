## Course 6 content

Each course of this certificate program is broken into modules. You can complete courses at your own pace, but the module breakdowns are designed to help you finish the entire Google Cybersecurity Certificate in about six months.

What’s to come? Here’s a quick overview of the skills you’ll learn in each module of this course.

### Module 1: Introduction to detection and incident response 

You will be introduced to detection and incident response, and the steps involved in the incident response process. You'll also explore how cybersecurity professionals verify and respond to malicious threats.


### Module 2: Network monitoring and analysis

You will learn the importance of network monitoring, and how to understand network traffic. Then, you'll explore how to use network protocol analyzer tools, commonly referred to as packet sniffers. In particular, you'll sniff the network and analyze packets for malicious threats. You'll also craft filtering commands to analyze the contents of captured packets.


### Module 3: Incident investigation and response

You will learn about the various processes and procedures in the stages of incident detection, investigation, analysis, and response. Then, you'll analyze the details of suspicious file hashes using investigative tools. You'll also learn about the importance of documentation, evidence collection, the triage process, and more.


### Module 4: Network traffic and logs using IDS and SIEM tools

You will explore logs and their role in IDS and SIEM tools. You'll learn how these systems work to help cybersecurity teams monitor systems and detect malicious activity. You’ll also be introduced to some IDS and SIEM products, and practice using tools to perform queries.
