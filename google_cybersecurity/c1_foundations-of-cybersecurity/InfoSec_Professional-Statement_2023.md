# Professional Statement | Cybersecurity/InfoSec

As a growing technology professional with a foundation in cloud engineering, IT, and DevOps, I am actively expanding my expertise to encompass cybersecurity principles and practices. This initiative stems from witnessing firsthand the challenges and threats faced by cloud-based organizations, including the damaging effects of ransomware and targeted attacks. My aim is to strengthen my capabilities in cybersecurity, thereby enhancing my overall effectiveness in the fast-evolving tech landscape.

My journey is marked by a commitment to continuous learning and improvement, particularly in areas such as programming, communication, and both offensive and defensive security strategies. I am driven by the realization that cybersecurity is integral not only to protecting data and infrastructure but also in safeguarding the lifestyles and achievements we cherish in our society. In this context, I see my role as a proactive contributor, striving to counteract the emerging digital threats and to support the development of resilient and secure systems.

The field of cybersecurity captivates me for its critical role in the defense of our digital and societal values against malicious forces. My pursuit in this domain is motivated by a sense of duty to be part of the collective effort to protect and preserve what we, as a community, have built. I am eager to apply my growing knowledge and skills to real-world challenges, aiming to make a meaningful difference in how we approach and manage digital security.

As I continue to navigate and grow within the intersections of cloud engineering, IT/DevOps, and cybersecurity, I look forward to collaborating with teams and organizations that value innovation and vigilance in the digital realm. My goal is to contribute a fresh, security-minded perspective, helping to fortify our defenses and spearhead initiatives that not only secure but also propel us forward in this digital age.

### Sincerely,
