# Course 7 Overview

<br>

Hello, and welcome to Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python, the seventh course in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. You’re on an exciting journey!

By the end of this course, you will develop a greater understanding of computer programming in Python and how Python can be effectively used to automate security-related tasks. You will start with key foundational concepts in Python, including data types, variables, conditional statements, and iterative statements. You'll then develop functions in Python and work with string and list data in a variety of ways. Finally, you'll explore algorithms that involve importing and parsing files.

## Course 7 content

Each course of this certificate program is broken into modules. You can complete courses at your own pace, but the module breakdowns are designed to help you finish the entire Google Cybersecurity Certificate in about six months.

What’s to come? Here’s a quick overview of the skills you’ll learn in each module of this course.

### Module 1: Introduction to Python

You will get an introduction to the Python programming language and how Python is used in cybersecurity. You'll also explore foundational Python concepts, including data types, variables, conditional statements, and iterative statements.


### Module 2: Write effective Python code

You will expand your ability to work with Python. You'll learn about prebuilt and user-defined Python functions. You'll also explore how modules help provide access to reusable code. Finally, you'll focus on code readability.


### Module 3: Work with strings and lists

You will learn more options for working with strings and lists in Python, and you will discover methods that can be applied to these data types. You'll apply this knowledge to write a short algorithm. Finally, you'll use regular expressions to search for patterns in strings.


### Module 4: Python in practice

You will put Python into practice and focus on automating cybersecurity-related tasks. You'll be introduced to opening and reading files. Then, you'll learn to parse files and structure their contents. Finally, you'll focus on strategies for debugging code.

## What to expect

Each course offers many types of learning opportunities:

* **Videos** led by Google instructors teach new concepts, introduce the use of relevant tools, offer career support, and provide inspirational personal stories. 

* **Readings** build on the topics discussed in the videos, introduce related concepts, share useful resources, and describe case studies.

* **Discussion prompts** explore course topics for better understanding and allow you to chat and exchange ideas with other learners in the discussion forums.

* **Self-review activities** and **labs** give you hands-on practice in applying the skills you are learning and allow you to assess your own work by comparing it to a completed example.

* **Interactive plug-ins** encourage you to practice specific tasks and help you integrate knowledge you have gained in the course.

* **In-video quizzes** help you check your comprehension as you progress through each video.

* **Practice quizzes** allow you to check your understanding of key concepts and provide valuable feedback.

* **Graded quizzes** demonstrate your understanding of the main concepts of a course. You must score 80% or higher on each graded quiz to obtain a certificate, and you can take a graded quiz multiple times to achieve a passing score.
