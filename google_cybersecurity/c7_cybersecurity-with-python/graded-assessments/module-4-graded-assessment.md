## Python in practice


<br>

### Question 1

You want to check for unusual login activity. Specifically, you want to read a log file that contains information on each login attempt, including whether it failed or was successful. You should then parse the data into a logins list, and then you should separate all failed log entries into a separate failed_logins list. If you want to automate this through Python, what would be part of your code? Select three answers.

* **An if statement to check if a login attempt failed**

* A counter variable to keep track of the number of failed logins

* **A for loop to iterate through all items in the logins list**

* **A split() function to split the login information into a list**

### Question 2

What are the three types of errors you will encounter while debugging?

* Exceptions, logic errors, iterative errors

* Syntax errors, exceptions, and comment errors

* Logic errors, comment errors, and iterative errors

* **Syntax errors, logic errors, and exceptions**
