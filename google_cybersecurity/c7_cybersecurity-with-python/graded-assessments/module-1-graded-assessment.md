### Question 2

You want to check the string stored in an update_status variable. When it contains a value of "incomplete", you want to print a "schedule update" message. Right now, this conditional statement is not correct. What are the problems with this conditional statement? Select all that apply.

if update_status != "incomplete"

    print("schedule update")


* **A colon (:) is missing at the end of the conditional header.**

* The line with print("schedule update") should not be indented. 

* **The operator should not be !=. It should be ==.**

* There should be quotation marks around the variable update_status.
